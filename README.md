# My Polibar Theme Setup



![desktop.png](/home/fede/.config/polybar/resources/desktop.png)

Made for my x230 using Pop OS.
Taken from this [Polybar themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) repository.

The theme is the polybar-8, I just tweaked it to work on my current setup.

PS: The wallpaper is not mine.

## Installation

Copy the folder on ~/.config/polybar

## Usage

```bash
./launch.sh
```
